                <h2>How to get started</h2>
                <p>Unlike many outdoor sports, <a href="index.html">getting started with bouldering</a> is surprisingly simple. All you need are some climbing shoes, chalk, and a positive attitude—most gyms even rent the equipment for your first sessions. <strong>No prior experience or complex gear required!</strong></p>
